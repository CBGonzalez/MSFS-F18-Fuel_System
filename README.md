# MSFS-F18-Fuel_System
A correction to the stock MSFS F18

An attempt to correct the F/A-18 fuel system.
Problems targeted:
- Wing tanks remain unused
- Left engine shuts down while fuel still onboard

Apart from that, try to replicate the original´s tank/pump/fuel line layout.

# ALERT: the flight_model.cfg file contained here leads to a sim CTD!!! DON´T USE AS IS!!!
